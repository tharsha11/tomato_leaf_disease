**The Problem It solves:**
It helps to find the leaf diasese for tomato leaves in a easy and simple manner.'Tomato Leaf Detection Using Transfer Learning in TensorFlow's Convolutional Neural Networks.' Within this project, we've tapped into the realms of artificial intelligence and deep learning to confront a pivotal issue in agriculture â€“ the detection of tomato leaf diseases. Utilizing the power of Transfer Learning in TensorFlow's Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), we've established a robust system proficient in identifying prevalent tomato leaf diseases. This groundbreaking innovation holds the promise of transforming agricultural practices by enabling early disease detection, facilitating timely interventions, and ultimately augmenting crop yield. I'm excited to delve into the methodology, tools, results, and the profound significance of this project in tomorrow's presentation.
